# GE2-2021-2022-Assignment
This is my assignment for games engine .

For my assignment i want to make the destruction of alderaan from star wars in episode 4 of Star Wars. A new hope.

I chose this scene due to the fact that it was one of the first scifi movies i ever saw and it helped form my taste in entertainment.
